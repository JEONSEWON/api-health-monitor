### First Comment (Your Story)

```
👋 Hey Product Hunt!

I'm excited to launch CheckAPI - a simple but powerful API monitoring service I built to solve a problem we've all faced: finding out your API is down from an angry user, not your monitoring tool.

## The Problem 💔
Existing monitoring solutions are either:
- Too expensive ($50-100/month for basic features)
- Too complex (takes 30 minutes just to set up)
- Too ugly (UI stuck in 2015)
- Not developer-friendly (no API, no webhooks)

## The Solution ✨
CheckAPI gives you:
- ⚡ Setup in 60 seconds (literally)
- 🔔 5 alert channels (Email, Slack, Telegram, Discord, Webhook)
- 📊 Real-time analytics and uptime tracking
- 💰 Affordable pricing ($5-15/month, free tier available)
- 🎨 Modern UI built with Next.js 14

## Tech Stack 🛠️
- Backend: FastAPI + Celery + Redis
- Frontend: Next.js 14 + Tailwind CSS
- Deployment: Railway + Vercel
- Payment: LemonSqueezy

## What's Next 🚀
I'm actively working on:
- Mobile app (PWA)
- Team collaboration features
- Advanced analytics
- More integrations (Zapier, Make)

## Try it! 🎉
Free tier includes 3 monitors with 5-minute checks - no credit card required.

Thanks for checking it out! 🙏

Key features:
- Monitor APIs/websites every 30s-5min
- Alert via Email, Slack, Telegram, Discord, or Webhooks

Tech stack:
