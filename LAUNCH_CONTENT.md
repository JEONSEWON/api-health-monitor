### Step 5: First Comment (포스팅 직후 바로 댓글)

```
👋 Hey Product Hunt! I'm Sewon, and I'm excited to launch CheckAPI!

## The Problem 💔
Legacy monitoring tools are either too expensive (Pingdom at $75/mo, Datadog at $100+/mo) or have outdated UIs stuck in 2010. 

As an indie hacker, I needed something:
- Affordable (not enterprise pricing)
- Fast to setup (60 seconds, not 20 minutes)
- Modern UI (built in 2024, not 2010)
- Developer-friendly (APIs, webhooks, open source)

## The Solution ✨
CheckAPI is built for indie hackers and small teams:

**🎨 Modern Experience**
- Built with Next.js 14 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
- Clean, intuitive interface
- Setup your first monitor in literally 60 seconds

**💰 Affordable Pricing**
- Free: 3 monitors forever
- Starter: $5/mo (20 monitors, 1-min checks)
- Pro: $15/mo (100 monitors, 30-sec checks)

Compare to enterprise tools:
- Pingdom: $75/mo
- Datadog: $100+/mo
- Better Stack: $20+/mo

**🔓 Open Source for Transparency**
- MIT license
- Full code on GitHub
- Open for learning and contributions
- Complete transparency

**🔔 Multi-Channel Alerts**
- Email, Slack, Telegram, Discord, Custom Webhooks
- Get notified instantly when your API goes down

## Tech Stack 🛠️
- **Backend:** FastAPI + Celery + Redis (for task scheduling)
- **Frontend:** Next.js 14 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
- **Deploy:** Railway (backend) + Vercel (frontend)
- **Payment:** LemonSqueezy
- **Development:** OpenClaw AI coding assistant

## Built with AI 🤖
I used **OpenClaw** - an AI coding assistant - to build this entire project in 6 weeks. What would traditionally take 3-4 months (or more), AI-assisted development made possible in 6 weeks.

OpenClaw actually executes code, deploys to production, manages git, and handles the entire dev workflow. This is the future of indie hacking!

#buildinpublic #AIcoding

## Key Features 🎯
✅ HTTP/HTTPS monitoring (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, HEAD)
✅ Customizable intervals (30s to 1 hour)
✅ Response time tracking & trends
✅ Automatic incident detection
✅ Public status pages
✅ Multi-channel alerting

## What Makes It Different 🌟

**Not competing with enterprise tools** - CheckAPI is built specifically for:

- Small teams (2-10 people)
- Anyone who wants modern UX without enterprise pricing

Think of it as: "Notion vs Confluence" but for API monitoring.

## What's Next 🚀
Planning to add:
- Mobile app (PWA enhancement)
- Team collaboration features
- More alert channels
- Advanced analytics
- Zapier/Make integrations

## Try it Free! 🎉

Monitor your APIs and websites 24/7, get instant alerts via Email, Slack, Telegram, Discord, or Custom Webhooks when something goes wrong.

### Post 2: r/webdev (토요일 추천)

**Title:**
```
Built a modern API monitoring SaaS in 6 weeks - CheckAPI (FastAPI + Next.js 14)
```

**Content:**
```
I spent 6 weeks building **CheckAPI** - a modern API monitoring service for indie hackers. Wanted to share the tech stack and lessons learned.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

**Backend:**
- **FastAPI** (Python) - Chose over Django for speed & modern async
- **Celery + Beat** - Background health checks every 30s-5min
- **Redis** - Message broker
- **SQLAlchemy** - ORM (SQLite → Postgres ready)
- **JWT** - Authentication
- **LemonSqueezy** - Payment (Stripe alternative, great for non-US)

**Frontend:**
- **Next.js 14** - App Router (not Pages Router)
- **TypeScript** - Type safety
- **Tailwind CSS** - Rapid UI development
- **Zustand** - Lightweight state management
- **Axios** - API client with auto token refresh

**Deployment:**
- **Railway** - Backend + Worker (love this platform!)
- **Vercel** - Frontend
- **Custom domain** - checkapi.io

## 🎯 What it does
Monitor APIs 24/7, send alerts via Email/Slack/Telegram/Discord/Webhooks. Track uptime, response times, incidents.

## 🧠 Technical Challenges & Solutions

**1. Celery + Beat in one process**
- Challenge: Railway needs combined worker+scheduler
- Solution: `celery -A app.celery_app worker --beat --concurrency=2`

**2. Multi-channel alert system**
- Challenge: 5 different APIs (Email, Slack, Telegram, Discord, Webhook)
- Solution: Abstracted in `alerts.py` with common interface

**3. LemonSqueezy webhook verification**
- Challenge: HMAC signature kept failing
- Solution: Must read raw body BEFORE JSON parsing

**4. Next.js 14 App Router learning curve**
- Challenge: Different from Pages Router
- Solution: Embraced server components, minimal client components

**5. Token refresh without UX interruption**
- Challenge: JWT expiry handling
- Solution: Axios interceptor auto-refreshes on 401, retries request

## 📊 Architecture
```
User → Vercel (Next.js) → Railway (FastAPI) → SQLite
                             ↓
                     Celery Worker (Railway)
                             ↓
                     Redis (Railway)
```

## 💰 Pricing
Affordable for indie hackers:
- Free: 3 monitors
- Starter: $5/mo (20 monitors)
- Pro: $15/mo (100 monitors)

## 🔓 100% Open Source
MIT License: https://github.com/JEONSEWON/api-health-monitor
