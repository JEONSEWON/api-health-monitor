## Full Description (for detail page)

### The Problem

You're building a SaaS product. Your API goes down. Your users notice before you do. Emails flood in. Trust is lost.

Existing monitoring tools are either:
- 💸 **Too expensive** ($50-200/month for basic monitoring)
- 🐌 **Slow to set up** (10+ minutes of configuration)
- 😤 **Outdated UI** (feels like it's from 2015)

### The Solution

**API Health Monitor** is a modern API monitoring service built for indie hackers and small teams.

⚡ **60-second setup**  
Set up your first monitor in less than a minute. No complicated configuration.

📬 **5 alert channels**  
Get notified via Email, Slack, Telegram, Discord, or custom webhooks. You choose how.

📊 **Beautiful analytics**  
Track uptime, response times, and incidents with a clean, modern dashboard.

🌍 **Public status pages**  
Share your API status with customers. Build trust through transparency.

💰 **50% cheaper**  
Starting at just $5/month. Free plan available with 3 monitors.

## First Comment (Your maker comment)

👋 Hey Product Hunt!

I'm excited to launch **API Health Monitor** - a project I've been working on for the past few weeks.

### Why I built this

As an indie hacker, I've used Pingdom, UptimeRobot, and other monitoring services. They work, but:
- They're expensive ($50-200/month)
- Setup takes forever
- UIs feel outdated
- Not built for indie hackers

I wanted something **simple, affordable, and modern**. So I built it.

### How I built it (the interesting part! 🤖)

I used **OpenClaw** - an AI coding assistant - to accelerate development.

**What's OpenClaw?**  
Think Claude/ChatGPT, but it actually executes code, manages files, deploys to production, and handles the entire dev workflow.

**With OpenClaw's help, I:**
- Built the entire backend (FastAPI + Celery) in 3 days
- Created frontend (Next.js 14) in 4 days
- Integrated payments (LemonSqueezy) in 2 days
- Deployed to Railway & Vercel in 1 day
- Fixed bugs and iterated rapidly

**Total: 6 weeks from idea to launch** (would've taken 3-4 months solo)

This is the future of indie hacking - AI pair programming that actually works. 🚀

### What it does

Monitor your APIs 24/7 and get instant alerts when something goes down.

**Key features:**
- ⚡ 60-second setup
- 📬 Multi-channel alerts (Email, Slack, Telegram, Discord, Webhook)
- 📊 Real-time analytics & uptime tracking
- 🌍 Public status pages
- 💳 LemonSqueezy payments built-in
- 🎨 Modern UI (Next.js 14 + Tailwind)

### Tech stack (for the nerds 🤓)

**Backend:** FastAPI, SQLite, Redis, Celery  
**Frontend:** Next.js 14, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS  
**Infrastructure:** Railway (backend), Vercel (frontend)

**Open source:** Core monitoring engine will be open-sourced soon!

### Pricing

Starting at **$5/month** (50% cheaper than competitors)  
**Free plan:** 3 monitors, 5-minute checks, no credit card required

### What's next

- [ ] Mobile apps (iOS & Android)
- [ ] Custom status page domains
- [ ] Team collaboration features
- [ ] API access for advanced users
- [ ] Multi-region checks
