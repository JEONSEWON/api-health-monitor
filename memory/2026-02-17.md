- Subscription management
- Webhook signature verification

### Performance

## 📝 Lessons Learned

### What Went Well
1. **FastAPI** - Extremely fast development, excellent docs
2. **Next.js 14** - App Router is powerful once understood
3. **Railway** - Easiest backend deployment ever
4. **LemonSqueezy** - Simpler than Stripe for Korea-based dev
5. **Tailwind CSS** - Rapid UI development
6. **OpenClaw** - AI-assisted development accelerated everything

### Challenges Overcome
1. **Celery + Beat** - Combined worker config tricky but working
2. **Webhook Signatures** - Raw body reading for HMAC verification
3. **User Management** - Finding user by email vs custom_data
4. **Modal Text Colors** - CSS specificity issues with Tailwind
5. **Favicon Generation** - Node.js sharp library solution

### What I'd Do Differently
1. Start with PostgreSQL instead of SQLite
2. Set up automated tests earlier
3. Create more reusable React components
4. Document API as I build, not after
5. Test email alerts earlier (SendGrid setup)

---

## 🎯 Next Steps (Immediate)

1. **Launch on Product Hunt** (morning PST preferred)
2. **Tweet announcement thread**
3. **Post on Reddit** (r/SideProject, r/webdev)
4. **Share in communities** (Discord, Slack)
5. **Monitor first users** (logs, errors, feedback)
6. **Fix duplicate subscription bug** (post-launch priority)
7. **Add email alerts** (if users request it)

## 🔄 Afternoon Update (2026-02-17 2:00 PM - 4:00 PM)

### Product Hunt Launch Scheduling

#### Discovery: Immediate Launch Not Possible
- Product Hunt doesn't allow immediate launch
- Must schedule for next available day (PST midnight reset)
- Earliest available: February 18, 2026 (Wednesday)

**Decision:** Scheduled for **Feb 18, 2026 5:01 PM KST** (Feb 18 12:01 AM PST)

#### Launch URL Change
```
Preview: https://www.producthunt.com/products/checkapi?launch=checkapi
Live (18th): https://www.producthunt.com/posts/checkapi
```

---

### Launch Content Final Revisions

#### Iteration 1: Competitor Analysis Response
**Trigger:** Claude AI analysis pointing out UptimeRobot comparison weakness

**Key Insights:**
- UptimeRobot: 50 free monitors vs CheckAPI 3 (significant gap)
- Price comparison misleading ($7 vs $5, but UptimeRobot has more features)
- Zero trust vs 210M users challenge

**Strategic Pivot:**
```
❌ Removed: "50% cheaper than competitors"
✅ Added: "Modern alternative to legacy tools"
✅ Focus: Indie hackers (not enterprise competition)
✅ Emphasis: 2024 UX vs 2010 design
```

**Commits:**
- `eac1fc7` - "Update launch content - more accurate positioning"
- Messaging shift from price war to experience + target market

---

#### Iteration 2: OpenClaw AI Story Integration

**Decision:** Highlight AI-assisted development as differentiator

**Added Content:**
```
Product Hunt Description:
🤖 Built in 6 weeks with OpenClaw AI coding assistant

First Comment:
## Built with AI 🤖
Used OpenClaw - what would take 3-4 months traditionally, 
done in 6 weeks with AI-assisted development.

Twitter Thread:
Tweet 5: "Built with @OpenClaw_AI"
Tweet 7: "Open Source + AI-Powered"
```

**Rationale:**
- Unique story angle
- Product Hunt loves AI tools
- Win-win: CheckAPI + OpenClaw promotion
- Developer curiosity driver

**Commit:** `4c45ce5` - "Add OpenClaw AI story"

---

#### Iteration 3: Open Source Messaging Refinement

**Issue:** "Self-hostable" could discourage SaaS purchases

**Solution:**
```
❌ "Self-hostable if you want"
✅ "Open source for transparency"
✅ "Open for learning and contributions"
```

**Reasoning:**
- Ghost, GitLab, Supabase = successful open source SaaS
- Emphasize transparency over DIY hosting
- Most users prefer managed SaaS ($5) over self-hosting complexity

**Same Commit:** `4c45ce5`

### Strategic Messaging (Final)

#### Core Positioning
```
Target: Indie hackers & small teams (NOT enterprises)
Value Props:
1. Modern UX (2024 vs 2010)
2. Affordable ($5-15 vs $75-100)
3. AI-built (6 weeks story)
4. Open source (transparency)
```

#### Differentiation
```
Not competing with: UptimeRobot (budget tool)
Competing with: Legacy enterprise tools (Pingdom, Datadog)
Analogy: "Notion vs Confluence" for monitoring
```

#### Hashtag Strategy
```
Primary: #buildinpublic #indiehacker
Secondary: #SaaS #API #AIcoding
Platform-specific: #opensource (Reddit)
```

---

### Key Learnings (Afternoon Session)

1. **Product Hunt Mechanics:**
   - No instant launch capability
   - PST midnight reset = natural scheduling
   - Preview URLs are private, live URLs are /posts/

2. **Competitor Analysis Value:**
   - Claude's critique was harsh but accurate
   - Forced better positioning (indie hackers, not price war)
   - Messaging now more defensible and authentic

3. **OpenClaw Story Power:**
   - AI development angle = unique differentiator
   - Natural curiosity driver ("how did you build it?")
   - Mutual benefit (CheckAPI + OpenClaw visibility)

4. **Open Source Strategy:**
   - "Transparency" > "Self-hostable"
   - SaaS + open source = proven model
   - Reduces technical barrier perception

5. **Launch Preparation Buffer:**
   - Extra day = blessing in disguise
   - Time for final fixes and polish
   - Reduced launch day stress
